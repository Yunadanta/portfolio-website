      <p id="bio">
        A digital hermit who is online far more than he probably should be, even
        before Umbrella released the C-Virus. Finding something interesting to
        learn is my passion, a passion which I will send most of my time doing
        for quite a while afterwards. A scholar by another name, having the
        opportunity to learn something new and exciting is what drives me.
        <br /><br />
        Learning a wide variety of skills from many different areas; from scuba
        diving, to astronomy, to basic video-editing and being a part-time Letâ€™s
        Player on Youtube for a short while, to programming, and numerous other
        unusual things in-between, has giving me a very logical and technical
        mind-set and approach to anything and everything I undertake.
